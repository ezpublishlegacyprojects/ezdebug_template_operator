eZDebug extension for eZ publish
===================================

This extension adds a new template operator: eZDebug.
It is meant to print any information you need into the debug part at the bottom of
the html pages (unlike what the "attribute" operator does) and at the same time
in the eZ Publish logs.

It has the advantage that calls to eZDdeug do not need to be removed from the
templates before going into production.

A common use case is: print the name of the template you are entering, at the
beginning of every included template. This helps in identifying the template file
that is generating some warning or error message, as often you will have many
templates in use, and the template error messages will carry no file/line information.

example usage:

{concat("Current node: ",$node.node_id)|eZDebug()}

{"ASSERT FAILED: WE SHOULD NEVER BE HERE!"|eZDebug('error')}

debug levels supported: notice, debug, warning, error
