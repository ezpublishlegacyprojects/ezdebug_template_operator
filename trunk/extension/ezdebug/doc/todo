. remove unused images and corresponding styles in css

. decide how to fix yui2 vs yui3 problem:
  . treeview is in yui2 but not in 3
  . Y.io is in yui3 but not in 2
  . ezjscore is not in ezp 4.0 or 4.1 anyway (but version 1.2 can be downloaded and installed from projects.ez.no)

a- move to yui3 + the 2-in-3 loading (needs yui >= 310)
b- stay w. yui2 and port Y.io.ez to yui2
c- move to other ajax libs

. make js loading more friendly to yui:
  if ezjscore is found, leave it up to yui to load the js
  otherwise do it by ourselves
