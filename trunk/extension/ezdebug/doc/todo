objInspect operator:
. allow user to see object attributes sorted alphabetically
. test using YUI 2.8.1
. show a friendly error msg if user has no access rights to ws calls (can be tested before ws call is actually made)
. move to usage of a yui dynamic tree instead of all hardcoded style/event changes for nodes
. remove unused images for a smaller distribution zip
. make js loading more friendly to yui:
  if ezjscore is found, leave it up to yui to load the js,
  otherwise do it by ourselves (need the 2-in-3 yui hacks)
. use doc from ezpersisentobject_inspector extension (how?)
